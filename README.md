# Integration_doc_gen
This is a work-in-progress. The aim is to develop a software that will take codebase and configuration of a system as input and generate a Integration architecture document of the said system.
Firstly, for the integration architecture we are looking at different connections/integrations our system is making externally. For that we are looking for API endpoints.
We have managed to write a snippet which when used manually with several HTML codes, yields all the API endpoints. We are working on automating this by processing the snippet on uploaded HTML code.
