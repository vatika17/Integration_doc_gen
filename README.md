# Integration_doc_gen
This is a work-in-progress project. The aim is to develop a software that will take codebase and configuration of a system as input and generate a Integration architecture document of the system.
We have managed to write a snippet of code, which when used with several HTML codes yields all the API endpoints. We are working on automating this by processing the snippet on uploaded HTML code.
